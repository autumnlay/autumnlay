Hi! My name is Autumn Lay and I am currently studying to be a full-stack web developer.

I am a hard worker and like to finish the things that I start

I was working in a fulfillment center for precious metals for nearly two years, decided that was not for me so i started to study to become a web developer. 

I also have 2 years of education, 2 years of work experience and 2 years of fulltime volunteer work under my belt. 

I have experience working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have been exposed to Java and C++

Fun facts about me: 
I used to have to carry a gun to work.
I love whitewater rafting.
I can tell a the difference between a fake gold or silver coin just by dropping it on a table.
